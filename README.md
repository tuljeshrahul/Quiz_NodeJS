# Quiz_NodeJS
This is a simple quiz application using Node.js that tests users' knowledge on Node.js concepts. The application will be built with Express.js to handle HTTP requests and serve quiz questions to users.


A set of 10 multiple-choice questions related to foundational Node.js topics like modules, callbacks, and event loop will be included. Users will be able to submit their answers to the quiz questions. Their responses will be evaluated and a score will be calculated and displayed based on the correctness of answers.


Feedback on individual answers, specifying whether they are right or wrong along with the actual answer, will be provided.
